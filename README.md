The user will be prompted to enter information about the team manager, 

- Team manager's:
    - Name
    - Employee ID
    - Email address


-  Menu with the option
    - Add an engineer
    - Add an intern
    - Finish building the team
- Engineer option 
    - Engineer's Name
    - ID
    - Email
    - GitHub username

- Intern option
    - Internâ€™s name
    - ID
